# PIC-CAT_O

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Have you ever wondered what you would look like as a cat? Have you also had the desire to make that image into an NFT that you exclusively give to me? Well you have come to the right place. Pic-Cat-O, sounds similar to Picasso, is a web application that leverages machine learning to generate cat photos from user submitted headshots. It then allows the user to either save those locally or generate the photo and leverage the Etherium blockchain to mint a brand new NFT.

This is a project that was created by Scott Plunkett, a senior crafter at 8th Light, as a way for me to learn before I went off to work for my first client. It started on 18 July 2022 and will end on 29 July 2022.
